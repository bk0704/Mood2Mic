## How It Works

1. You enter a short mood message (like a tweet)

## Model

We fine-tuned the [cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emotion](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emotion) model to also classify the emotions of various rap lyrics

- **Base Model:** twitter-roberta-base-emotion (trained on 58M tweets)
- **Fine-tuning:** A dataset of rap lyrics classified as joy/optimism/anger/sadness
- **Output:** Label + confidence (e.g., "joy", 92.1%)
- **Framework:** HuggingFace Transformers

The emotion label is then used to generate a music search prompt via Perplexity.ai.
